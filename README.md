# Yet another weather service

* Self-hosted *RESTful* service built with *Asp.Net WebApi*.
* The API has *two endpoints* - weather for today, weather for the whole week - and accepts city as a parameter. Build the data structures which you find suitable. 
* Anonymous authentication, open to everyone. No additional security requirements.
* You can use some predefined data as a data source or if you have enough time and interest feel free to use any existing Weather API service to pull the actual data.
* *No specific database storage* required, feel free to store the data wherever you want (in memory, in a file, etc.)
* In order to prevent request flood we introduce customizable rate limits. *Each API endpoint* should have its own rate limit settings defined by its own *extendable set of rules* which are *based on user's IP address*. If *any of applied rules do not pass* return rate limit exceeded HTTP error instead of doing actual work. 
* It should be easy to implement and enforce rules to API endpoints without modifying much code. Feel free to choose the approach how you'd implement this extensibility requirement. We'd like to see your own (yet simple) implementation instead of using an existing NuGet package. 
* Example rate limit rules to implement: N allowed endpoint requests per IP address per selected period, N minutes passed since previous user's request.
* Implement any *tests (unit, integration)* you consider valuable and reasonable.
* If you need any other NuGet packages except mentioned above feel free to use them.
* Imagine this is a real production code you used to write and apply all the principles you use during your daily routine.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to create a github [Issue](https://github.com/sviataslau/crexi/issues) where we can address all the controversial points.
* Please, make a fork of the repository, start an *own branch named 'Your-Name-implementation'* and submit your *changes as a PR* when you're ready 
Happy coding and good luck!
